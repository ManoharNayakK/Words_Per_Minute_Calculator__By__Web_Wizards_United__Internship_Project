# Words_Per_Minute_Calculator__By__Web_Wizards_United__Internship_Project
This web app calculates typing speed and accuracy by generating random quotes from an API and comparing user input. It stores results in local storage and allows users to subscribe to a newsletter, storing their emails in a separate file.

The project aimed to achieve the following objectives, and all of them have been satisfied:

❖ Provide a user-friendly interface: The application has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface with clear instructions on how to use it.

❖ Fetch a random quote from an external API: The application connects to an external API to fetch a random quote, providing a wide range of unique and challenging tests.

❖ Display the quote and highlight each character: The fetched quote is displayed on the screen, with each character highlighted to indicate typing accuracy in real-time.

❖ Track user typing speed: The application tracks the time taken to complete the test and calculates the typing speed in words per minute, which is displayed at the end of the test.

❖ Allow users to view previous test results: Users can view their previous test results, including their typing speed and accuracy, allowing them to track their progress over time which are stored in the local storage.

❖ Keep track of user mistakes: The application keeps track of the user's mistakes, which can be used to provide feedback and help improve their typing skills.

❖ Allow users to restart the test: Users can restart the typing test at any time, without having to reload the page or navigate away from the application.

❖ Ensure GDPR compliance: The application obtains user consent to store their email address and provides an easy way to unsubscribe or delete their email address, ensuring GDPR compliance.

❖ Track subscription metrics: The application tracks subscription metrics such as the number of new subscribers, unsubscribes, and growth rate of subscribers, providing insights for future marketing efforts.

❖ Improve user experience: The application adds client-side validation to check for duplicate email addresses, provides immediate feedback to the user, and sends a confirmation email after subscription to confirm opt-in.

❖ Allow the user to view their subscribed email list: The application displays the list of subscribed emails in a table format on the web page, allowing users to view their subscribed email list.

❖ Provide a user-friendly message when no subscriptions are found: A user-friendly message is displayed when there are no subscribed emails found, encouraging users to subscribe if they haven't already.
